        <h3>Welcome to BoxLib Codes</h3>

	<p><a href="https://ccse.lbl.gov/BoxLib/"><code>BoxLib</code></a>
	  is a C++/Fortran library for block-structured adaptive mesh
	  refinement, developed at
	  the <a href="http://ccse.lbl.gov/">Center for Computational
	  Sciences and Engineering</a> / Lawrence Berkeley National
	  Laboratory.</p>

	<p>This <a href="https://github.com/BoxLib-Codes">github
	organization</a> hosts a number of simulation codes that use
	  <code>BoxLib</code> to manage their discretization and
	  parallelization.  Descriptions to the codes and links to
	  their github repos are given below.</p>

	<p><code>BoxLib</code> itself can be obtained from its git repo:
	<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/BoxLib-Codes/BoxLib.git</code></pre>


	<h3>Contributing</h3>

	<p>Contributions are welcomed through github's pull-request
           system.  Note that all new development should be done on
           the <tt>development</tt> branch for each code.  Once
           accepted changes successfully pass our regression tests,
           the development branch will be merged to <tt>master</tt>.</p>

	
	<h3>Castro</h3>

	<p><a href="http://boxlib-codes.github.io/Castro/">Castro</a>
	  is a fully compressible adaptive mesh refinement radiation
	  hydrodynamics code.  Castro uses an unsplit PPM algorithm
	  for hydrodynamics, uses a general equation of state and
	  reaction network, and solves self-gravity (the Poisson
	  equation) via multigrid.</p>

	<p>It uses the C++ BoxLib library to manage the grid structure
	      and parallelism.</p>

	<p>More information on using Castro can be found in the 
           <a href="http://bender.astro.sunysb.edu/Castro/staging/Castro/UsersGuide/CastroUserGuide.pdf">Castro User's Guide</a>.</p>

	
	<h3>CastroRadiation</h3>

	<p>CastroRadiation provides the flux limited diffusion solver
           support for the main Castro simulation code.  A gray and 
           multigroup solver are implemented.</p>

	<h3>Maestro</h3>

	<p><a href="http://boxlib-codes.github.io/MAESTRO/">Maestro</a>
	  is a low Mach number hydrodynamics code for stellar flows.
	  Maestro solves a reformulation of the Euler equations that
	  filters soundwaves from the system but retains the
	  compressibility effects due to local heat release /
	  diffusion, compositional mixing, and the background
	  stratification of the stellar atmosphere.  These effects are
	  captured through an elliptic constraint on the velocity
	  field.</p>

	<p>The Maestro algorithm uses a second-order Godunov method
	  to evolve the advective portion of the equations and an
	  approximate projection to enforce the constraint on the
	  velocity.  Reactions are incorporated via Strang splitting.</p>

	<p>Maestro uses the Fortran 90 portion of <code>BoxLib</code>
	   to manage the grid structure and parallelism.</p>

	<p>More information on Maestro can be found on
	  its <a href="http://boxlib-codes.github.io/MAESTRO/algorithm/">project
	  page</a>, and full details are given in
	  the <a href="http://bender.astro.sunysb.edu/Maestro/staging/MAESTRO/Docs/MaestroUsersGuide.pdf">Maestro
	  User's Guide</a>.</p>


        <h3>Microphysics</h3>

        <p>Microphysics contains reaction networks, equations of
	  state, and other physics routines that are written in a
	  general fashion so that they can be used both by Maestro and
	  Castro.</p>

	<h3>Nyx</h3>

	<p><a href="http://boxlib-codes.github.io/Nyx/">Nyx</a>
	  is an N-body hydro cosmological simulation code.
          Nyx uses an unsplit PPM algorithm for hydrodynamics, 
          and solves the Poisson equation for self-gravity using multigrid.</p>

	<p>It uses the C++ BoxLib library to manage the grid structure and parallelism.   
           MPI and OpenMP can be used separately or together.</p>

	<p>More information on using Nyx can be found in the 
           <a href="https://ccse.lbl.gov/Research/NYX/NyxUserGuide.pdf">Nyx User's Guide</a>.</p>

	<h3>Varden</h3>

	<p>Varden is a adaptive mesh, variable-density incompressible
	solver that uses a second-order approximate projection method.
	It uses the Fortran BoxLib library to manage the grid.



	<h3>wdmerger</h3>

	<p>wdmerger contains the problem setup and analysis routines to
           simulate merging white dwarfs with Castro.</p>
